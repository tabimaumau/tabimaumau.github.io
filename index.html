		  <p>In the next few tabs you will be seeing some assignments that I have completed in my 2nd semester of Intro To Programming with Mr. Ryan. On the first tab you will see my personal favorite assignment which was Go Fish! This was the assignment that really showed me the love that I have for coding. I had a lot of fun with this one and tried my best to add my own personality into it. The next assignment is Barcode Array. I choose this specfic assignment because I personally worked very hard on it. The challenge that we were faced with really showed me how much I have grown in this class, which was very rewarding. Next, I decided to show my Binary Lights assignment. My reason for this was that I really liked the background that I choose and was also very proud of my work. My fourth tag was also another one that I choose because it was probably one of the hardest assignments that we were given this whole semester. It took about 3 class periods to solve and once we finally got it, I felt a peak of accomplishment, epecialy for this class. My last and final tab is probably the simpilist of them all. The reason for this was because this assignment was the turning point for me personally in this class. Before this challenge was given to us I had absolutely no intrest in coding whatsoever. I actally was starting to grow a hate for it, however, this was the first assignment that I actually really understood front and back and once I was done with it, I realized that with effort and hard work the things that you thought were once impossible are possible. This assignment alone made the whole class for me and everything after was so enjoyable for me. </p>
